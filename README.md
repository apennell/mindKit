# MindKit

### A first pass at creating a tool to retrain your brain for positive thinking, based on exercises and ideas from cognitive behavioral therapy.

This repo is the frontend, created with Ionic for native browsing. However, it was built for my 3rd and final project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive and I was unable to finish in the one week alloted. While it wasn't all that I dreamed of, it is a solid display of what I'm capable of learning and executing on my own in a week! Now with more experience under my belt, I hope to continue this project by rebuilding it using React instead, as that is my current favorite tool.
